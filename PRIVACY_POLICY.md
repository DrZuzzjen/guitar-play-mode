## Overview

Guitar Play Mode is a browser extension that provides a distraction-free view for guitar chord and tab websites. This privacy policy explains how we handle user data.

Guitar Play Mode does not:
- Collect personal information

## Local Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your preferences:
- Column layout preferences (2, 3, 4, or auto columns)
- Hidden text blocks for each song URL

This data is stored **locally on your device only** and is never transmitted anywhere. You can clear this data at any time by removing the extension.

These permissions are used solely to provide the extension's functionality.
